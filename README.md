QNAP TS-233 NAS:

Drive Bays: The QNAP TS-233 has two 3.5-inch SATA drive bays, and it supports both 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch drives, as long as they use the SATA interface.

Interface: It supports SATA III (6Gb/s), which matches the interface of the HP S750 1TB SSD.

Power: The QNAP NAS uses a 65W power supply, which is adequate for running the SSD without any issues, as SSDs are low-power devices.

HP S750 1TB 2.5" SATA SSD:

Interface: It uses a SATA III (6Gb/s) interface, which matches the QNAP NAS’s support for SATA drives.

Form Factor: The SSD is 2.5", so you may need a 2.5" to 3.5" adapter if you're installing it in the 3.5" drive bay of the NAS, but most NAS devices (like the QNAP TS-233) come with an adapter for this purpose.

Conclusion:

The QNAP TS-233 NAS and the HP S750 1TB SSD are fully compatible with each other in terms of interface (SATA III) and power requirements. If you’re planning to install the SSD in the 3.5-inch bays, make sure you have the appropriate adapter for the 2.5-inch drive (which is typically provided by the NAS manufacturer).
